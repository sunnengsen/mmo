WATERMARK REMOVAL ISSUE RESOLUTION - FINAL SUMMARY
==================================================

ORIGINAL PROBLEM:
"it not working we still see the watermark"

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
The watermark detection was finding only small fragments of watermarks (like 21x38 pixel areas)
instead of the complete watermark areas (which could be 300x60 pixels or larger).
This meant the removal process was only removing tiny parts of watermarks, leaving most of the
watermark visible.

IMPROVEMENTS IMPLEMENTED:
