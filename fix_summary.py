WATERMARK REMOVAL ISSUE RESOLUTION SUMMARY
===========================================

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
The watermark removal system was detecting both fixed and moving watermarks correctly,
but was only removing ONE watermark instead of removing ALL detected watermarks.

ROOT CAUSE:
The _remove_multiple_watermarks() method in video_operations.py had a "TODO" comment
and was only removing the highest confidence watermark, not all watermarks.

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
1. Enhanced _remove_multiple_watermarks() method to handle multiple watermarks properly
2. Added _remove_combined_watermarks() method for efficient removal of multiple watermarks
3. Enhanced worker_thread.py to handle combined watermark removal with stronger filters
4. Improved detection and grouping logic for better watermark handling

CHANGES MADE:
